              IPC 2023: International Planning Competition

                        Call for Participation

======================================================================

The International Planning Competition is organized in the context of
the International Conference on Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). It
empirically evaluates state-of-the-art planning systems on a number of
benchmark problems. The goals of the IPC are to promote planning
research, highlight challenges in the planning community, and provide
new and interesting problems as benchmarks for future research.

This year, the IPC will contain a track for:

-- Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning --

The track will conclude together with ICAPS, in June 2020, in Nancy 
(France). This time it is organized by Gregor Behnke, Daniel Höller,
and Pascal Bercher.

Based on a online poll we agreed on a quite basic feature set and the
following three tracks:

- Totally ordered HTN planning without recursive structures
- Totally ordered HTN planning with recursive structures
- Partially ordered HTN planning with recursive structures

We use the agile metric, i.e., planners must find solutions as quickly
as possible, regardless of their quality (see our website).

A competing team may participate for any track, so competitors are
strongly encouraged to participate in every track supported by their
planners. Details regarding the rules and evaluation criteria of all
tracks can be found at the competition website.

As in other IPC parts, the competitors must submit the source code of
their planners that will be run by the organizers on the actual
competition domains/problems, unknown to the competitors until this
time. This way no fine-tuning of the planners will be possible.

All competitors must submit a 2-page short paper describing their 
planners. After the competition we encourage the participants to 
analyze the results of their planner and submit an extended version 
of their paper (max. 4 pages). An important requirement for IPC 2020 
competitors is to give the organizers the right to post their paper 
and the source code of their planners on the IPC 2020 website.
