TOAD - Total Order HTN Approximation with DFA.
You have compiled TOAD without setting the NDEBUG flag. This will make it slow and should only be done for debug.
Reading HTN model from file "domain-problem.psas" ...

- Domain contains 21 actions. [numActions=21]
- Domain contains 31 tasks. [numTasks=31]
- Domain contains 28 methods. [numMethods=28]
- The initial state contains 6 set bits.
- The initial task is "__top[]".
- State-based goal contains 2 bits.
