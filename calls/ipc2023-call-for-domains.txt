                        Call for HTN Domains

======================================================================


We are delighted to announce the International Conference on Planning and
Scheduling (ICAPS) 2023 in Prague will host a next iteration of the
International Planning Competition (IPC). It empirically evaluates
state-of-the-art planning systems on a number of benchmark problems. The goals
of the IPC are to promote planning research, highlight challenges in the
planning community, and provide new and interesting problems as benchmarks for
future research.


The IPC 2023 will again feature a track on HTN planning. Despite the last IPC in 2020,
there is still only a limited set of benchmark domains available to evaluate
domain-independent HTN planning systems.

If you have an interesting domain or idea, please let us know!

 - If you have a domain suitable for the competition or would be 
   willing to design one, please let us know. We will collaborate 
   in adapting the domains to suit the IPC.
 - If you have an interesting idea, please let us also know, maybe 
   we can help in modeling it.

We ask you to think about:
 - Why is that particular domain suitable to be modeled in HTN planning?
 - Is it easily to scale the problem's difficulty?

Even better than a domain alone (plus a number of problem instances)
would be a problem generator. But this is optional, of course. If a 
domain-dependent (optimal) planner for the submitted domain is available, 
please include it in the submission.

The deadline for domain submissions is February 28th 2023. We kindly request
that people planning to submit domains express their interest to do so
by December 31st 2022.

We will consider all submissions and select the highest quality subset to be
included. We are aware that participants that submit a domain that is used
may have an advantage with respect to performance on that domain. We view this
as a good incentive for teams to submit high quality proposals.

As one of the goals of the IPC is to provide a new (publicly available)
set of benchmarks for future research, we plan to publish all domains
selected for IPC 2023 in a public repository. By submitting a domain,
you agree to this and give us the rights to do so. We recommend that you
also license your domain under a permissive license such as CC-0 so
that others can use and build on your domain.

If you have a domain in mind but have doubts whether it would be appropriate
for the IPC, don't hesitate to contact us!

For each submission domain that is selected, we highly encourage the authors to
submit a paper describing the domain. These paper will be made publicly available. 

If you have a domain in mind but have doubts whether it would be
appropriate for the IPC, don't hesitate to contact us!
