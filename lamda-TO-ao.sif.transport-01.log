    Source 26 is a primitive action.
    Action has an effect.
    Performed all sources that can be taken greedily. 1 sources remain. unique=true
    Attempting to progress through source 26
    Task is: drop truck_0 city_loc_2 package_1 capacity_0 capacity_1
    Applying effects of the action.
     Removing fact from state: capacity truck_0 capacity_0
     Removing fact from state: in package_1 truck_0
     Adding fact to state: at package_1 city_loc_2
     Adding fact to state: capacity truck_0 capacity_1
    The new state is:
      at package_0 city_loc_0
      at package_1 city_loc_2
      at truck_0 city_loc_2
