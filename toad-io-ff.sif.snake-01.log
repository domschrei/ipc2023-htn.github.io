TOAD - Total Order HTN Approximation with DFA.
You have compiled TOAD without setting the NDEBUG flag. This will make it slow and should only be done for debug.
Reading HTN model from file "domain-problem.psas" ... 
- State has 53 bits divided into 13 mutex groups. [statebits=53] [statevars=13]
- Domain contains 624 actions. [numActions=624]
- Domain contains 671 tasks. [numTasks=671]
- Domain contains 515 methods. [numMethods=515]
- The initial state contains 10 set bits.
- The initial task is "__top[]".
