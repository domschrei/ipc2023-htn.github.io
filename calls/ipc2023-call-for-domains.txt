                2023 International Planning Competition

                        Call for HTN Domains

======================================================================

The IPC 2023 will contain a track on HTN planning. 


There is only a limited set of benchmark domains available to 
evaluate domain-independent HTN planning systems. If you have an 
interesting domain or idea, please let us know!

 - If you have a domain suitable for the competition or would be 
   willing to design one, please let us know. We will collaborate 
   in adapting the domains to suit the IPC.
 - If you have an interesting idea, please let us also know, maybe 
   we can help in modeling it.

We ask you to think about:
 - Why is that particular domain suitable to be modeled in HTN planning?
 - Is it easily to scale the problem's difficulty?

Even better than a single domain (plus a number of problem instances)
would be a problem generator. But this is optional, of course. If a 
domain-dependent planner for the submitted domain is available, please 
include it in the submission.

We will consider all submissions and select the highest quality subset
to be included. We are aware that participants that submit a domain
that is used have some advantage with respect to performance on that
domain. We view this as a good incentive for teams to submit high
quality proposals.

For each submission domain that is selected, there will be the option 
to submit a paper describing the domain that will be made available on 
the website of the track.

If you have a domain in mind but have doubts whether it would be
appropriate for the IPC, don't hesitate to contact us!
